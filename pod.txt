#To create a pod using pod.yml file
  kubectl create -f pod.yml 

#To check the pods
  kubectl get pods -o=wide

#Sort the nodes according to node Names
kubectl get pods -o=wide --sort-by"{.spec.nodeName}"

#Pods are getting deployed to the nodes by selecting nodes randomly. 

#How to run a pod on a specific Node?
Here we will get the labeling and node selector comes into picture. 

#To attach label to a perticular node
kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label>
#TO get the node name
kubectl get nodes

example: 
  kubectl label nodes ip-172-31-29-9 az=b
  
 #To verify the label is attached or not
  kubectl get nodes --show-labels
 
#We need to add node selector in a pod.yaml file and run yaml file
  kubectl create -f pod.yml 
 
#Try to create a new pods by changing the pod name in pod.yml file and verify the in which node pod got deployed. 

Note: 
  Node selector is continuos to work as expected but in future it is going to be deplicated and it will be replaced by node effinity. Node effinity is an advanced concept which we will see further.

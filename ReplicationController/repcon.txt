#To run the repcon.yml to create pods
    kubectl create -f repcon.yml
#To see the ReplicationController 
    kubectl get rc 
#To check the pods
    kubectl get pods

#Observation: Refer the pod names and this pods are maintained by the rc.

#Now we can see in which nodes these pods got deployed. 
    kubectl get pods -o=wide

#Try to change the replicas count from 3 to 4 and try to run the "repcon.yml" using "apply". 
we cannpt use "kubectl create -f repcon.yml" as we have already created the rc and now we are 
just modifying the rc. TO modify or change the state we need to use apply as below. 
    
    kubectl apply -f repcon.yml
